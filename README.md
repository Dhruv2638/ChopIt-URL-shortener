# chopIt - URL Shortener

### What is a URL shortening service?
A URL shortening service is a website that substantially shortens a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The short URL redirects the client to the URL of the original website. Some popular public-facing URL shortening services are tinyurl.com and bitly.com1.

5) Service should collect metrics like most clicked links
6) Once a shortened link is generated it should stay in system for lifetime

### Non-Functional Requirements:
